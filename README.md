# 365-API

Our main idea for our API group would be to implement some sort of Pokemon Trading Card game. This could include utlizing read functions in order to access the types of packs available, as well as their associated costs. We could also use read functions to also display the types of cards available in each pack. As for our other functions, we could use PokeCoins, or some other currency in exchange for these packs, using write operations to update accordingly.
